        <p>Hello! My name is Yenny Jacoby. I am originally from Colombia and I moved to the
            United States eight years ago, a country I truly love. I am currently studying software
            development and I am
            excited about everything I have learned so far, as well as the many things still ahead.
            I am
            passionate about technology and confident that with dedication, effort, and continuous
            practice, I will
            achieve my professional goals.

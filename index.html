        <p>Hello! My name is Yenny Jacoby. I am originally from Colombia and I moved to the
            United States eight years ago, a country I truly love. I am currently studying software
            development and I am excited about everything I have learned so far, as well as the many
            things still ahead.
            I am passionate about technology and I feel confident that with dedication, effort, and
            continuous
            practice, I will achieve my professional goals.</p>

        <p>Colorado is full of live, is a beautiful state known for its breathtaking mountains and
            lush green
            landscapes. 1 Colorado fact: It has 58 mountain peaks over 14,000 feet—more than any
            other U.S.
            state, which is why they are called “fourteeners.” 🏔️

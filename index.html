            <p>Hello! My name is Yenny Jacoby. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I had the opportunity to serve a mission in Bolivia, South America—an amazing country that brought me many blessings, growth, and unforgettable experiences. That time in my life strengthened my faith, helped shape my character, and taught me the value of service, perseverance, and empathy. I am originally from Colombia, and I moved to the United States eight years ago, a country I truly love. Adjusting to a new culture and language was challenging at times, but it also helped me become more resilient, adaptable, and determined.  I am currently studying software development, a field that genuinely excites me. I enjoy learning how technology works and how creative problem-solving can be used to build meaningful and functional solutions. Every new concept I learn motivates me to keep growing, and I feel confident that through dedication, effort, and continuous practice, I will achieve my professional goals. I am married and the proud mother of two children: a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son. My son is curious, energetic, and very playful, always exploring the world around him. My daughter is sweet, talented, and highly artistic, and she inspires me with her creativity. Being a mother has taught me patience, organization, and the importance of balancing responsibilities—skills that also support me in my academic and professional journey.  Looking ahead, I hope to continue developing my skills in technology and contribute positively through my work. I value continuous learning and believe that combining my personal experiences, education, and strong work ethic will allow me to make a meaningful impact both professionally and personally.

            <h2>Colorado</h2>
            <img src="images/colorado.jpg" alt="colorado landscape">
            <p>Colorado is a state that feels like several worlds rolled into one, defined by dramatic landscapes, an active outdoor culture, and a strong sense of independence and innovation. Known as the Centennial State because it joined the Union in 1876, Colorado is famous for the Rocky Mountains, which cut across the state and shape both its scenery and lifestyle. Towering peaks, alpine lakes, and vast forests make it a paradise for outdoor lovers, with activities like hiking, skiing, snowboarding, rafting, camping, and mountain biking woven into everyday life rather than treated as special occasions. Beyond the mountains, Colorado also has wide-open plains, high deserts, red rock formations, and fertile valleys, showing a surprising geographic diversity.  🏔️

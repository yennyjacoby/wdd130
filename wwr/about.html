                <h2> History</h2>
                <p> This company was born from a father’s love and a daughter’s laughter. Our
                    founder
                    discovered rafting
                    through his daughter, whose joy on the river was contagious—her laughter echoing
                    over rushing water,
                    her smile brighter than the sun. Wanting to give her a place where she could
                    always
                    feel free,
                    happy, and safe, he built more than a business; he built a dream.
                </p>
                <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Daughter and dad playing in the water">
                <p> What began as a way to make his daughter happy became a place where families,
                    friends, and
                    adventurers can share that same joy. Every trip we guide carries the same
                    purpose it
                    started with:
                    laughter, connection, and unforgettable moments on the river. At Splash White
                    Water
                    Rafting, every rapid tells a story, and every guest becomes part of our
                    family.</p>

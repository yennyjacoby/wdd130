            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> This company was born from a father’s love and a daughter’s laughter. Our founder
                discovered rafting
                through his daughter, whose joy on the river was contagious—her laughter echoing
                over rushing water,
                her smile brighter than the sun. Wanting to give her a place where she could always
                feel free,
                happy, and safe, he built more than a business; he built a dream.

                What began as a way to make his daughter happy became a place where families,
                friends, and
                adventurers can share that same joy. Every trip we guide carries the same purpose it
                started with:
                laughter, connection, and unforgettable moments on the river.</p>
